### 5. State Management

- Integration with state management libraries like Redux or Mobx for easy data sharing between components.

### 6. API Requests

- Implementation examples of how to make requests to external APIs using libraries like Axios or fetch.

### 7. Development Environment Ready

- Configuration of the development environment with hot-reloading for enhanced productivity during development.

### 8. Build and Deploy

- Configuration options for creating optimized builds and deployment to different environments such as Vercel, Netlify, and more.
